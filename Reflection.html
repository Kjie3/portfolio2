<p1>When doing python, I notice that many things and concepts are similar to scratch when we are doing loops and variables but there needs to be more clarification and also there seems some different logic with the ordering of the commands and information. Debugging the program was a bit difficult because it was often just small adjustments to multiple parts of code. But using the program that pointed out which line was giving the program a problem and even pointing to where in the specific line there was a mistake, it was easier locating it but since we were also inexperienced, even knowing where the problem was it was difficult knowing exactly what needed to be added, adjusted or deleted. But even though it was difficult it was still pretty fun because it was really cool when we were finally able to understand how it worked.</p1>
