<h1>Reflections</h1>
<h2>July 6th 2017</h2>
<p1>When doing python, I notice that many things and concepts are similar to scratch when we are doing loops and variables but there needs to be more clarification and also there seems some different logic with the ordering of the commands and information. Debugging the program was a bit difficult because it was often just small adjustments to multiple parts of code. But using the program that pointed out which line was giving the program a problem and even pointing to where in the specific line there was a mistake, it was easier locating it but since we were also inexperienced, even knowing where the problem was it was difficult knowing exactly what needed to be added, adjusted or deleted. But even though it was difficult it was still pretty fun because it was really cool when we were finally able to understand how it worked.</p1>

  <p1>We tried many different things but when trying the different methods I think we realized that we didn't understand the concepts as well as we first thought because when we saw it on the powerpoint, it seemed easy to understand but when we saw the actual parts of the light that we needed it was more confusing. The parts threw us off a little and then we started trying to look at the image on the powerpoint which also confused us because I don't think we recreated it right as well. Working as a group was nice because we could at least be confused together and we were trying different things. It was helpful when we had someone putting the parts together while explaining it because hearing it, it was hard to fully visualize it and seeing it was hard to follow. We finally did get it after help from everyone else so that was good</p>
