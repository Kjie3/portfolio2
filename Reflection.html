<p1>When doing python, I notice that many things and concepts are similar to scratch when we are doing loops and variables but there needs to be more clarification and also there seems some different logic with the ordering of the commands and information. Debugging the program was a bit difficult because it was often just small adjustments to multiple parts of code. But using the program that pointed out which line was giving the program a problem and even pointing to where in the specific line there was a mistake, it was easier locating it but since we were also inexperienced, even knowing where the problem was it was difficult knowing exactly what needed to be added, adjusted or deleted. But even though it was difficult it was still pretty fun because it was really cool when we were finally able to understand how it worked.</p1>

  <p1>We tried many different things but when trying the different methods I think we realized that we didn't understand the concepts as well as we first thought because when we saw it on the powerpoint, it seemed easy to understand but when we saw the actual parts of the light that we needed it was more confusing. The parts threw us off a little and then we started trying to look at the image on the powerpoint which also confused us because I don't think we recreated it right as well. Working as a group was nice because we could at least be confused together and we were trying different things. It was helpful when we had someone putting the parts together while explaining it because hearing it, it was hard to fully visualize it and seeing it was hard to follow. We finally did get it after help from everyone else so that was good</p1>

  <p1>My idea of robots changed today by ways of understanding how fuzzy the definition of robots are considering many different things in fiction and in real life can be considered robots by one set of rules and can't by another and there is not right set of rules for what qualifies as a robot. I am excited by the amount of new things that can be created with robots, how we can become safer and things can be more accessable but I am nervous for the vulnerability to hackers in increasing areas of our lives and also the lack of privacy with some technological developments. When working with circuits in a group, while we did not complete it on our own, we were able to compare and try different things. Next time I think we should ask for help and clarification instead of just trying to figure it out.</p1>

  <h3>Veloso's work is with making interactive IA that are able to efficantly communicate with each other and humans and Howard's work is with making hardware that makes the internet more accessable for more people with motor problems so they both deal with human interaction with technology and getting more accurate responses. Today we have programed the robot to have a little light show. I didn't do much of actually typing the code, mostly trying to research fixes to problems on the internet, suggesting ideas and helping wire the circuit. Ankita did some coding and was also wiring and researching and Juehye did a majority of the programming. We had some problems with the proper way to wire it and also figuring out if the lights didn't work or if was the coding that was the problem so we learned some stuff about using process of elimination to find solutions so we can do that better in future projects. The basic pieces of a Arduino sketch is the setup which establishes the outputs, also the pin assignments and also the commands for the sequences such as loops.</h3>

      <p>I have learned how circuits wires need to be arranged so that they are connected to recieve the commands and also how the curcuit charges work when doing these projects. I did not have a dance to the part that I coded but I really like when Juhye's routine included it deciding to chase and attack people, that was pretty cool. I think that Howard would need outputs such as scrolling down or up a screen, selecting and mouse movements for her arm band that helps people use the computer. Veloso would need motion outputs for her soccer playing dogs to kick the ball.</p>

     <p>When we were working for the maze code, we all individually worked on our own computers with out own versions of the code but we helped each other when we needed it and gave each other tips. During this project I learned that I need to not assume and do more research online for what works since when we were programming the wheels, we really were not sure how it worked because at first it was just going around in circles. Then we found a website that explained how to do properly steer in Arduino</p>

      <p>Today when we were working on Django and after working on it for a while and learning what it can do, I would really like to learn how to have information that slides open when the title is scrolled over with the mouse. I don't really understand the use of the models part of the programming but I am really excited to learn how to change pictures on websites later.</p>
